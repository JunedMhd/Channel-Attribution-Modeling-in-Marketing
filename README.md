# Channel-Attribution-Modeling-in-Marketing
An e-commerce company conducted a survey and collected data from its customers. This can be considered as representative population. In the survey, the company collected data about the various touch points where customers visit before finally purchasing the product on its website.<br><br>
We need to help the e-commerce company in identifying the right strategy for investing in marketing channels. Which channels should be focused on? Which channels should the company invest in? We’ll figure this out using R
# Markov Chains
Markov chains is a process which maps the movement and gives a probability distribution, for moving from one state to another state. A Markov Chain is defined by three properties:

- State space – set of all the states in which process could potentially exist
- Transition operator –the probability of moving from one state to other state
- Current state probability distribution – probability distribution of being in any one of the states at the start of the process

# Outcomes
The scenario is clearly visible from the above graph. From the first touch conversion perspective, channel 10, channel 13, channel 2, channel 4 and channel 9 are quite important; while from the last touch perspective, channel 20 is the most important (in this case, it should be because the customer has decided which product to buy). In terms of linear touch conversion, channel 20, channel 4 and channel 9 are coming out to be important. From the total conversions perspective, channel 10, 13, 20, 4 and 9 are quite important.

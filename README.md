Channel Attribution Modeling in Marketing (using Markov Chains and R)
# Markov Chains
Markov chains is a process which maps the movement and gives a probability distribution, for moving from one state to another state. A Markov Chain is defined by three properties:

- State space – set of all the states in which process could potentially exist
- Transition operator –the probability of moving from one state to other state
- Current state probability distribution – probability distribution of being in any one of the states at the start of the process
